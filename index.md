We're just setting up our cohousing project and currently looking for members and land in Hackney.

Regular (likely monthly) meetup time is going to be announced here soon!

If you're interested to hear more, sign up to our newsletter using the link in the top right corner.

We're aiming at a 10-20 flat development and prices falling within Affordable Housing standards, depending on the type of funding and amount of grants we can raise.

## Our founding principles

   * Solving big city isolation by **building a community** of people living together and not just living next to each other
   * Consisting of people with **shared values, but diverse** professional and cultural **backgrounds**
   * **Young family focused** with dedicated children play / learn areas
   * Realising and keeping up the project with a few hours per week shared contribution to **turn inhabitants into makers instead of users**
   * **Affordable for first time buyers** using cooperative / ethical / eco funding
   * **Private flats with** small internal areas but **flexible spaces** aiming to reduce number / size of bedrooms needed
   * **Communal areas** (kitchen, laundry, library, community hall, etc) **both for residents and** partially open for the **wider community**
   * Using light / reclaimed / locally available materials to **build with low embedded resource cost**
   * Several **sustainable features (targeting Passivhaus standards)** making the houses energy, water and waste efficient **achieving low running resource cost**
   * Using **technology** (web / sensors / etc) **to simplify booking and sharing space** (laundry, etc) and building efficiency (heating, lighting, etc)
   * Run as a **cooperative, with decisions based on consensus** between people
   * **Social enterprise aspect** with volunteering / rehabilitation opportunities, courses, space, etc
   * **Open sourced** building / service / organisational **designs**
   * **Bike shed instead of garages to save space**, relying on car sharing services nearby
