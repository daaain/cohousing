## Areas

### Yard / garden
   
   * Communal bike shed
   * Tool library
   * Outdoor seating / eating area with optional canvas roof including barbecue / fireplace / cob oven
   * Children’s play area
   * Vertical garden
   * Fruit trees
   * Grape arbour
   * Greenhouse (maybe made of plastic bottles?)
   * Compost pile
   * Food smoker?

### Roof

   * Solar panels and heaters with a roof extension will create a shelter so roof terrace is still usable in rain.
   * Sun deck with foldable lounge chairs
   * Communal herb / vegetable garden on the roof edges (maybe working with Growing Communities?)

### Flats

   * South (but at least east or west) facing, floor to ceiling windows, one with French balcony
   * Small internal area for each room, but stretched with reconfigurable Clei furniture (so for example no permanent beds, etc)
   * All LED lighting
   * Windows on every side (one flat tower footprint with shared stairwell?)

### Shared building

   * Community hall with kitchen
   * Laundry room (with hang drying)
   * Library / shared workspace / home school room
   * Smaller, flexible break out / activity rooms which can be used as guest sleeping rooms during night
   * Coworking space open for anyone but discounted for residents?
   * Sauna?

### Street-front

   * Low cost community shop premise?
   * Community hall entrance (with Budapest style teahouse)

## Shared / sustainable feature ideas

   * Communal solar PV panels for electricity with inverters and possibly 12V DC grid throughout the house (we’ll need some special smart meters?)
   * Communal solar hot water / heating with gas backup (condensing boiler and heat pump)
   * Underfloor / wall heating (for easily reconfigurable spaces) with smart controls (possibly Nest)
   * Solar PV on windows (Oxford PV)
   * Rainwater storage for toilet flushing via flat roof

## Sharing ideas

   * Freehold owned by a cooperative / social enterprise to keep control with inhabitants and accountability towards council / community
   * Web based services / infrastructure
      * to book communal areas / tools / laundry room
      * get sensor / booking / etc data
      * a system to be able to choose a mixture between volunteering or paying for services around the freehold
      * a system to order food together
   * Some communal facilities (hall / tea house / gardens) partially open to wider community
   * Each year for one month the guest room could be offered to host a previously homeless person in exchange for some communal work
